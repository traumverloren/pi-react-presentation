## Raspberry Pi + React = Pixel Art 🤖✨🎨
#### Adventures in trying out new hardware, code, and having fun in a personal project

This is a presentation/demo of my first hardware project, [Raspberry Pi Interactive LED Art project](https://github.com/traumverloren/rpi-unicorn-leds). This presentation goes over why I built it, how I built it, and includes a live demo!

I hope it inspires others to go outside their comfort zone, try new stuff whether it's unfamiliar languages or hardware, and make projects for no other reason than to make _them_ happy!

This was created using [ShowerJS](https://github.com/shower/shower/)!
